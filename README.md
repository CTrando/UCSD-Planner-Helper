# Description

This is a project to automate the creation of schedules based off
data from UCSD's Web Registration system.

Originally a desktop app, I have moved it to the web by popular
request, and now it will be free for everyone to use.

It is still a huge work in progress, and there are many bugs and features
to be added, and I will continue to improve this for at least the next few months.
